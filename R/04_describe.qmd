The final dataframe contains 62 observations(rows) and 1946 variables(columns). Each observation is a colorectal cancer sample. Of the 1946 variables, 1 is the sample ID, 10 are the sample metadata, and the remaining 1935 variables are different genes whose expression is measured.

The variables Age and Age_group contain the same information, just in a different format. The same goes for Dukes_stage and No_stage.

The variables DFS and DFS event both give information on Disease-Free Survival. DFS describes the length of time without the disease returning, and DFS event describes whether or not the disease returned.

```{r}
data |>
  count(DFS_event)
```

Out of the 62 patients, 25 showed disease free survival, while 37 showed a return of the disease.

    sd = sd
  ), na.rm = TRUE))

    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "Value"

  )

# Print the wide table
