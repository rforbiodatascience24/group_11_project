## Data Retrieval:

The dataset for this project is taken from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number [GSE50760](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE50760 "data download").

## Dataset Information:

### Source

The dataset was obtained from the study *Gene Expression Profiling by RNA-seq in Colorectal Cancer* ([GSE50760](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50760)), which aimed to identify a prognostic signature in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, addressing the diverse progression and heterogeneity of CRCs.

### Description

This RNA-seq dataset comprises 54 samples from 18 colorectal cancer patients. The samples are distributed across three conditions:

-   Normal colon tissue

-   Primary colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue

-   Liver metastases

### Data Generation

-   **RNA Isolation**: Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA), with quality confirmed via agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, followed by visual examination under ultraviolet light.

-   **Library Preparation**: mRNA was purified, fragmented, converted to cDNA, and amplified using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina).

-   **Sequencing**: Paired-end reads (2x100 bp) were generated using the Illumina HiSeq-2000 platform.
