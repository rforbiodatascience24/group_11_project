## Introduction

-   Background

    -   Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer mortality

    -   Gene expression analysis can help identify dysregulated genes

-   Goal of the project

    -   Investigate xxx

    -   Model xxx

-   Data sets

    -   Gene expression level for 1935 genes

    -   Patient information for 62 patients

    -   Artificially made dirty and messy to increase the difficulty of the projects

## Methods - Tidying the data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Expression data

-   The columns represent observations and the rows variables
    -   Pivot the data set
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Patient data

-   `DFS event/Adj_Radio/Adj_Chem` contains 3 variables

    -   Separate it into 3 distinct variables

-   Observations of column `DFS (in years and months)` contains two values

    -   Convert into months to have only value per observation
:::
:::

Combine the two data sets by joining on the patient ID.

## Methods - Cleaning the data

-   Missing values "N/A" and "NA"

    -   Load everything as NA when opening the file

-   Gender as "Male", "M", "Female", "F"

    -   Convert M to Male and F to Female

-   One patient has an Age \< 0

    -   Substitute it by the mean value of the age of the other observations

-   Long column names with several words

    -   Remove "gene\_" at the beginning of all the gene names

    -   Remove the units from the names

    -   Replace spaces by \_

## Methods - Augment the data

-   Create an age group variable

-   Create a metastasis variable

    -   Duke stage A, B, C don't involve metastasis

    -   Duke stage D involve metastasis

## Results - Data description
